##Object-Oriented Programming Assignment.


This project contains solutions to two object-oriented programming tasks. The first involves creating a custom class (such as a Car) with attributes, methods, and a constructor. It also includes an inheritance layer to demonstrate encapsulation and polymorphism in action.



All code is written in a single Python file. The second part of the assignment showcases polymorphism by having multiple classes implement the same method (e.g., speak()), each with its own unique behavior.
